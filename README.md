# Machine Learning-Powered Predictive Inventory Optimization for Retail

## Overview

Predictive Inventory Management for Retail is a data-driven system designed to optimize inventory levels, reduce waste, out-of-stock prediction, real-time forecasting, and improve operational efficiency for retail businesses. Leveraging machine learning models, the project aims to predict demand and enhance decision-making processes.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and normalizes features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides visual insights into sales trends and feature correlations.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses Random Forest Regression to predict inventory needs.
- **Model Optimization:** Includes hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - prophet

## Future Enhancements

1. **Model Integration:**

   - Develop an API endpoint to integrate the predictive model with live retail systems.

2. **Real-Time Prediction:**

   - Enable real-time predictions by connecting the system to live sales data streams.

3. **Multi-Model Support:**

   - Implement and compare additional algorithms like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.

4. **Dashboard Visualization:**

   - Build an interactive dashboard for inventory insights and decision support.

5. **Scalability:**

   - Extend the model to support multi-store data for chain retailers.

6. **Anomaly Detection:**

   - Include functionality to detect anomalies in inventory trends, such as sudden demand spikes.
